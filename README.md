### Ahoy! 👋

My name is Alida Vermeer, and I'm a software development student enrolled at Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology. I will be graduating sometime around August, 2025. 🎓
- 🌎 I'm **based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada**. 🍁
- 🌱 I'm **currently learning HTML5, CSS and JavaScript**. I don't have much coding experience yet, so I acknowledge that I am not yet qualified for the role of software dev. However, I know I'm capable of quality work when I actually know what I'm doing. 🧑‍💻 
- ✒️ I am an **avid writer** and **fluent in English and French**. 🗣️ 
- 📖 Fiction has always held a special place in my heart. My main motivator for learning to code is my **desire to use games as a storytelling medium**. 🖋️ 
- 🥅 I want to tell stories that speak to people, make them feel things. I want to create, not just apps and websites, but works of art that I can look back on with pride; things that spark joy. 👾
